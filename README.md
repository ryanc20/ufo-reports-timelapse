# UFO Report Timelapse
Timelapse heatmap of UFO reports in the U.S. from 1950-2014. Using a [dataset found online](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) I was able to explore potential visualizations before deciding this was the most interesting.

## Motivation
I recently discovered Kaggle, and have always been interested in extra-terrestrial life. I figured it would be a fun project to work on to develop my skills in data visualization and Python.
